# üîß Google Sheets Integration Troubleshooting

## üö® Current Issue: Authentication Required

Your Google Apps Script is currently redirecting to a login page instead of executing. This means the deployment settings need to be corrected.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fix Deployment Settings

### Step 1: Access Your Google Apps Script
1. Go to https://script.google.com/
2. Find your project "JolHub Registration Handler"
3. Open the project

### Step 2: Redeploy with Correct Settings
1. Click the **"Deploy"** button (top right)
2. Click **"Manage deployments"**
3. Click the **pencil/edit icon** next to your existing deployment
4. **CRITICAL**: Ensure these exact settings:
   - **Execute as**: `Me (your-email@gmail.com)`
   - **Who has access**: `Anyone` ‚ö†Ô∏è **This must be "Anyone"**
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. **Copy the new deployment URL**

### Step 3: Test the Fixed URL
The URL should look like:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
```

Test it by visiting the URL - you should see:
```json
{"message":"JolHub Registration Handler is running"}
```

Instead of a Google login page.

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Execute as" is wrong
**Solution**: Must be set to "Me" (your email), not "User accessing the web app"

### Issue 2: "Who has access" is not "Anyone"
**Solution**: Change from "Only myself" to "Anyone"

### Issue 3: Old deployment cached
**Solution**: Create a new deployment instead of updating existing one

### Issue 4: Script permissions not granted
**Solution**: Run the script once manually in the editor to grant permissions

## üß™ Test Your Fix

### Method 1: Browser Test
Visit your deployment URL directly - should show JSON response, not login page.

### Method 2: Form Test
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit and check browser console for success messages
4. Check your Google Sheet for new data
